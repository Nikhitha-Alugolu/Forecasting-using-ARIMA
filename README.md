Project Overview:

ForecastPro is a time series forecasting system that utilizes the ARIMA (AutoRegressive Integrated Moving Average) model to predict future values based on past data. The system aims to provide accurate and reliable forecasts for various applications, such as finance, economics, and weather.

Methodology:

1. Data Collection: Gather historical time series data
2. Data Preprocessing: Clean, preprocess, and normalize data for modeling
3. Model Development: Develop an ARIMA model using techniques like:
    - Autocorrelation analysis
    - Partial autocorrelation analysis
    - Model selection (e.g., ARIMA(p,d,q))
4. Model Evaluation: Validate model performance using metrics like mean absolute error (MAE), mean squared error (MSE), and root mean squared percentage error (RMSPE)
5. Forecasting: Generate forecasts for future time periods
